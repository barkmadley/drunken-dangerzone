==================

A toy app for playing around with knockback.

Loose idea:

* Pull together multiple streams from public API's
* Ability to add a Person, then link multiple public accounts together:
    * Twitter (tweets)
    * Github (commits)
* Puts everything together into a timeline / other representation.
